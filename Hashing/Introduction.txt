//Hashing
//Key is mapped in the Array at the index that is found using Hash function
//No Ordering

//3 Operations: -
//Insertion, Deletion, Search in O(c)
//We also need to avoid the collision

//Hash Function
//That converts a key into an integer

//Good H.F.: - 1. Reduce chance of Collisions that is Distribute Kes uniformly over table
//2. Should be Fast to compute
//Distribution More Imp

//M-1
//Index=key%TableSize
//So like if TS=10 and keys are 10,20,30,40 so they will land up at same space
//Table Size is not recommended to be 10 or like that 
//So TS is recommended to be a Prime Number

//if key is string
//Treat the strings as base 27
//a-1,b-2,c-3............z-26
//abc=(a+27b+27^2c)%TS
//Assumes first 3 chars are randomly distributed

//M-3
//batman: - n+a*37+m*37^2+t*37^3+.....



//Collision Handling Schemes
//3 Methods
//1. Open Hashing - Seperate Chaining
//2. Closed Hashing
//3. Double Hashing
